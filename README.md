<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Gen AI Projects:</h2>

- <b>Conversational AI-Driven Intelligent Agent-Based System for Automated Software Development Lifecycle</b>
  - Built a conversational, multi-agent platform that automates end-to-end SDLC‚Äîrequirements, design, code generation, review, QA, and CI/CD‚Äîwith Human-in-the-Loop approvals at each gate.
  - Implemented dual intake: document upload (PDF/DOCX) and chat UI; an LLM converts briefs into structured user stories and detailed design documents.
  - Orchestrated specialized agents for Requirement Analysis, Design, Code Generation, Code Review, Security Review, Test Case Authoring, QA, and Deployment via a workflow engine.
  - Ensured governance, safety, and compliance through HITL checkpoints and automated review agents without sacrificing delivery speed.
  - Built a Streamlit web UI with stage tracking, feedback loops, explicit approvals, live logging, and optional GitHub upload post-QA.
 
- <b>Salesforce Debug Log Analysis Using Generative AI</b>
  - Delivered a Salesforce-focused debug log module that uses deterministic regex parsing to segment logs into ‚Äúerror blocks‚Äù for triage, deep causal diagnosis, and iterative refinement.
  - Enforced evidence alignment by requiring cited stack frames and structured outputs (Summary, Root Cause, Evidence, Fix Steps, Prevention) for auditability.
  - Achieved structured, actionable diagnoses across 29 error blocks with composite quality ~4.0‚Äì4.3 and zero parsing failures in beta tests
  - Optimized cost and latency via session-scoped state, caching, change detection, truncation, and selective deep dives on targeted error blocks.
  - Defined explicit scope and constraints: Salesforce-first prototype, lightweight LLMs, human approvals at all gates, and no production hardening yet.
  - Outlined a production roadmap covering persistence and audit trails, stronger guardrails, retrieval enrichment, multi-model routing, observability, and enterprise integration.
